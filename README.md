# hello-world

Hello.  I am Clovis, a retired music teacher who's been teaching himself HTML, CSS, Jquery and Python.  I am currently enrolled in a Java class at microtrain, a fantastic learning center in downtown Chicago.  The last class I took at Microtrain enabled me to pass the A+ Certification Exam.  My interests are responsive and interactive websites and applications, and with my teaching background of course I am interested in building things that will help people learn.  I am very excited about bringing ideas to life using technology.
