# hello-world

Hello.  I am Clovis, a retired music-teacher/alchemist in web development for the moment. My vehichle of transition is   Microtrain in Downtown Chicago where I am finishing up an Agile Full-Stack Bootcamp. The last class I took at Microtrain enabled me to pass the A+ Certification Exam.  My interests are in building responsive and interactive websites and applications, and with my teaching background of course I am interested in building things that will help people learn.
