# hello-world

Hello.  I am Clovis, a retired music-teacher/alchemist in web development for the moment. My vehichle of transition is   Microtrain in Downtown Chicago where I am finishing up a Bootcamp covering topics in Agile Full-Stack Web Development with Responsive Mobile Applications.  After becoming A+ Certifide in April of 2018, I began contracting with Robert Half Technologies and Independent Book Publishers.   My interests are in exploring Java functionality in PDF environments, and teaching robotics.
